<h1>How to renew your skynet membership!</h1>
    
<h2>Thanks</h2>
    <p>Thank you for all your continued support throughout the years. Your contribution and the contribution of many others have made it possible for us to buy more servers which we use to give you the best service we can. With our new servers, we hope to improve the quality for our users and have less downtime.

 
  <p>You can now purchase a 5-year subscription for €40. This subscription is for a multi-year limited alumni membership of the Computer Society (This type of membership does not entitle you to society subsidies or places on trips). You must hold a Computer Society membership in order to hold a Skynet account.</p>

  <p>If there has been no payment made passed the point of expiration on your membership, Your Skynet account will freeze. You must pay for membership to unfreeze your account.</p>

  <p>Below are instructions on how to renew your subscription. Until you make both an account and pay membership, you will not have renewed your subscription. Once you have completed the steps below, you will have renewed your subscription and will be issued a receipt.</p>
    
  <p>When requesting membership, You have the option to pay online or pay cash. If you are paying online you can only pay for one year's membership.</p>

<h5>IMPORTANT!!</h5>
    
  <p1>If you are looking to avail of the 5-year membership it is important to note that you can no longer pay for this on the Ul wolves site. Please select the pay with cash option and transfer the multi-year fee to the bank account shown below. </p1>
    
 <p></p>
    
 <p1>If someone pays for membership for example in August for a 1 year membership they will only get 1 month of membership. We have to abide by the 1 year of membership equally 1 full academic year. If they had chosen a 5 year plan they will get 1 month and 4 years of value. (This could be satisfactory for some members).</p1>
